# PocketChip + Akrobin

An insert for the NTC PocketChip (portable computer) that allows it to
mount onto an Akrobin for display/charging/usage/storage.

Takes two M3 x 8mm socket head screw cap screws and hex M3 nuts (used to attach the pencil and pen pegs to the
  mount).

# Usage

1. Print the clip.

2. Print both the pencil / pen pegs.

3. Dry fit the M3 screws + hex nuts to ream out the print (skip if the hex
  nuts just fit)

4. Screw the pen and pencil pegs onto the clip with the M3 screws/hex nuts.

5. Push the clip down onto the front of the Akrobin.

6. Push the PocketChip into the pen/pencil pegs. It should be secure, but easily removable by pulling in the other direction.
